## What is ClojureWerkz?

Elastisch is part of the group of libraries known as ClojureWerkz, together with
[Monger](http://clojuremongodb.info), [Welle](http://clojureriak.info), [Quartzite](http://clojurequartz.info), [Neocons](https://github.com/michaelklishin/neocons), [Langohr](https://github.com/michaelklishin/langohr), [Validateur](https://github.com/michaelklishin/validateur), [Spyglass](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/spyglass) and several others.


## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, poor default, missing feature or find any part of the API inconvenient, please [file an issue](http://github.com/clojurewerkz/elastisch/issues) on Github.
If possible, try to explain what behavior you expected and why. Bonus points for contributing failing test cases.


## Contributing

Elastisch uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make sure you have it installed and then run tests against
supported Clojure versions using

    lein2 all test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all tests pass, submit a pull request
on Github.
