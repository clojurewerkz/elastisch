# Elastisch, a Clojure client for ElasticSearch

Elastisch is a minimalistic [Clojure client for ElasticSearch](http://clojureelasticsearch.info), a modern distributed RESTful search engine.


## Project Goals

 * Be reasonably feature complete
 * Be [well documented](http://clojureelasticsearch.info)
 * Be [well tested](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/elastisch/tree/master/test)
 * Closely follow [ElasticSearch API structure](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/), no new abstractions introduced
 * Follow recent ElasticSearch releases & developments
 * Target Clojure 1.3.0 and later from the ground up


## Community

[Elastisch has a mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure-elasticsearch). Feel free to join it and ask any questions you may have.

## Documentation & Examples

Please see our [documentation guides site](http://clojureelasticsearch.info/).

Our [test suite](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/elastisch/tree/master/test/clojurewerkz/elastisch) also has many code examples.



## Supported Clojure versions

Elastisch is built from the ground up for Clojure 1.3 and up. Clojure 1.4 is highly recommended.


## Elastisch Is a ClojureWerkz Project

Elastisch is part of the group of libraries known as ClojureWerkz, together with
[Monger](https://github.com/michaelklishin/monger), [Welle](https://github.com/michaelklishin/welle), [Langohr](https://github.com/michaelklishin/langohr), [Neocons](https://github.com/michaelklishin/neocons), [Quartzite](https://github.com/michaelklishin/quartzite) and several others.


## Continuous Integration

[![Continuous Integration status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/clojurewerkz/elastisch.png)](http://travis-ci.org/clojurewerkz/elastisch)


## Development

Elastisch uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make
sure you have it installed and then run tests against all supported Clojure versions using

    lein2 all test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all
tests pass, submit a pull request on Github.

## FAQ

### Why Not Just Wrap the Java Client?

Wrapping ES Java client may result in some performance gain but we don't see it to be great enough to be a significant factor for Elastisch.
Following Java client conventions would likely make Elastisch less Clojuric.
